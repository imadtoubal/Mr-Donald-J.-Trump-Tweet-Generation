# Abstract
Text generation is a popular problem in natural language processing with machine learning. It ranges from simple email replies, word suggestions to simulating DNA sequences, and unfortunately fake news. This project aims to implement a generative model to learn the speech style of Mr. Donald Trump based on a dataset of his speeches; and then, automatically generate an unlimited amount of new speeches in the vein of Trump´s previous speeches.

# Dataset
This project uses a dataset from Kaggle that contained Donald J. Trump’s tweets (https://www.kaggle.com/davidg089/all-djtrum-tweets) from between May 2009 to August 2018. The dataset originally included 7 columns: source, text, created_at, retweet_count, favorite_count, is_retweet, and id_str. 

# Running the code
Please make sure the following libraries are installed:
 - Tensorflow
 - html2text
 - nltk
 - gensim
